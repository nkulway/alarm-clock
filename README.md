# Alarm Chat
This project allows you to create an innovative alarm clock using a Raspberry Pi 4B and a photo-resistor. By running a simple Python script, the system can detect changes in light exposure. With this fun and straightforward home automation project, you can enhance your daily routine and wake up in a unique and interactive way.
